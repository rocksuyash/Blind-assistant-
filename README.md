# Blind-assistant 
->: A Project to build a system that converts visual input into audio signals which may lead to a practical product to help the blind or visually impaired person.

-> One of the major issues faced by Blind people is detecting and recognizing an object. The objective of this project is to help the blind people because mobility of blind people is always a great problem. 

-> The mobility of blind people in unknown environment seems impossible without external help, because they donâ€™t have any proper idea about their surroundings. So, we are developing a electronic eye which helps them to know about their surroundings and also guide them during travelling.
